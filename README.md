hey while I am at the store what couple things from here can I grab that you like?

My RefactorU course project using javascript full stack technologies...  helping build personal interaction between neighbors, co-workers, and friends.  While you are at a certain store, the app gives your peeples a way to see the couple things you'd love... and a good way to quickly catch up *in person* when picking them up!
